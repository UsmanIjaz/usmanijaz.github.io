</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Crime is an international concern, but it is documented and handled in very different ways in different countries. In the United States, violent crimes and property crimes are recorded by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  Additionally, each city documents crime, and some cities release data regarding crime rates. The city of Chicago, Illinois releases crime data from 2001 onward online.</p>
<p>Chicago is the third most populous city in the United States, with a population of over 2.7 million people. The city of Chicago is shown in the map below, with the state of Illinois highlighted in red. </p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="{attach}ChicagoMap.png" /></p>
<p>There are two main types of crimes: violent crimes, and property crimes. In this problem, we'll focus on one specific type of property crime, called "motor vehicle theft" (sometimes referred to as grand theft auto). This is the act of stealing, or attempting to steal, a car. In this problem, we'll use some basic data analysis in R to understand the motor vehicle thefts in Chicago. </p>
<p>Please download the file mvtWeek1.csv for this problem (do not open this file in any spreadsheet software before completing this problem because it might change the format of the Date field).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mvt = read.csv(&quot;mvtWeek1.csv&quot;)
str(mvt)
</pre></div>


<ul>
<li><strong>Date</strong>: the date the crime occurred</li>
<li><strong>LocationDescription</strong>: the location where the crime occurred</li>
<li><strong>Arrest</strong>: whether or not an arrest was made for the crime (TRUE if an arrest was made, and FALSE if an arrest was not made)</li>
<li><strong>Domestic</strong>: whether or not the crime was a domestic crime, meaning that it was committed against a family member (TRUE if it was domestic, and FALSE if it was not domestic)</li>
<li><strong>Beat</strong>: the area, or "beat" in which the crime occurred. This is the smallest regional division defined by the Chicago police department.</li>
<li><strong>District</strong>: the police district in which the crime occured. Each district is composed of many beats, and are defined by the Chicago Police Department.</li>
<li><strong>CommunityArea</strong>: the community area in which the crime occurred. Since the 1920s, Chicago has been divided into what are called "community areas", of which there are now 77. The community areas were devised in an attempt to create socially homogeneous regions.</li>
<li><strong>Year</strong>: the year in which the crime occurred.</li>
<li><strong>Latitude</strong>: the latitude of the location at which the crime occurred.</li>
<li><strong>Longitude</strong>: the longitude of the location at which the crime occurred.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dataset contains <strong>191641</strong> obs. of  <strong>11</strong> variables. <strong>9181151</strong> is the maximum value of the variable "ID". </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="x">max(mvt</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">ID</span><span class="x">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If we type summary(mvt) in your R console, we can see the summary statistics for each variable. This shows that the minimum value of Beat is <strong>111</strong>. Alternatively, we could use the min function by typing min(mvt$Beat).    </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="x">summary(mvt)</span>
<span class="x">min(mvt</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">Beat</span><span class="x">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If we type summary(mvt) in your R console, we can see the summary statistics for each variable. This shows that <strong>15,536</strong> observations fall under the category TRUE for the variable Arrest.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>summary(mvt)
</pre></div>


<p>This also shows that <strong>2,308</strong> observations fall under the category ALLEY for the variable LocationDescription. We can also read this from:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="x">table(mvt</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">LocationDescription</span><span class="x">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In many datasets, like this one, you have a date field. Unfortunately, R does not automatically recognize entries that look like dates. We need to use a function in R to extract the date and time. If we type </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="x">mvt</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">Date</span><span class="x">[1]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>in our R console, we can see that the first entry is 12/31/12 23:15. It is in the format Month/Day/Year Hour:Minute. Now, let's convert these characters into a Date object in R. In your R console, type</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="x">DateConvert = as.Date(strptime(mvt</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">Date</span><span class="x">, &quot;%m/%d/%y %H:%M&quot;))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This converts the variable "Date" into a Date object in R.</p>                </article>
