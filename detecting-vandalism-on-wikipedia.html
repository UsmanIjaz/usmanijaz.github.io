</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit and contribute to. It is available in many languages and is growing all the time. 
On the English language version of Wikipedia:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are currently 4.7 million pages.</li>
<li>There have been a total over 760 million edits (also called revisions) over its lifetime.</li>
<li>There are approximately 130,000 edits per day.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the consequences of being editable by anyone is that some people vandalize pages. This can take the form of removing content, adding promotional or 
inappropriate content, or more subtle shifts that change the meaning of the article. With this many articles and edits per day it is difficult for humans to 
detect all instances of vandalism and revert (undo) them. As a result, Wikipedia uses bots - computer programs that automatically revert edits that look like 
vandalism. In this assignment we will attempt to develop a vandalism detector that uses machine learning to distinguish between a valid edit and vandalism.</p>
<p>The data for this problem is based on the revision history of the page Language. Wikipedia provides a history for each page that consists of the state of 
the page at each revision. Rather than manually considering each revision, a script was run that checked whether edits stayed or were reverted. 
If a change was eventually reverted then that revision is marked as vandalism. This may result in some misclassifications, but the script performs well 
enough for our needs.</p>
<p>As a result of this preprocessing, some common processing tasks have already been done, including lower-casing and punctuation removal. 
The columns in the dataset are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vandal</strong> = 1 if this edit was vandalism, 0 if not.</li>
<li><strong>Minor</strong> = 1 if the user marked this edit as a "minor edit", 0 if not.</li>
<li><strong>Loggedin</strong> = 1 if the user made this edit while using a Wikipedia account, 0 if they did not.</li>
<li><strong>Added</strong> = The unique words added.</li>
<li><strong>Removed</strong> = The unique words removed.
Notice the repeated use of unique. The data we have available is not the traditional bag of words - rather it is the set of words that were removed or added. 
For example, if a word was removed multiple times in a revision it will only appear one time in the "Removed" column.</li>
</ul>
<p>Load the data <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/95579925/TA/wiki.csv">wiki.csv</a> with the option stringsAsFactors=FALSE, calling the data frame "wiki". Convert the "Vandal" column to a factor using the command wiki$Vandal = as.factor(wiki$Vandal).</p>
<p>We can load the data using the command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>wiki = read.csv(&quot;wiki.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
</pre></div>


<p>And then convert Vandal to a factor with the command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="x">wiki</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">Vandal</span><span class="x"> = as.factor(wiki</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">Vandal</span><span class="x">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We can then use the table command to see how many cases of Vandalism there are:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="x">table(wiki</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">Vandal</span><span class="x">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>There are 1815 observations with value 1, which denotes vandalism.</p>
<p>We will now use the bag of words approach to build a model. We have two columns of textual data, with different meanings. For example, adding rude 
words has a different meaning to removing rude words. We'll start by building a document term matrix from the Added column. The text already is lowercase and 
stripped of punctuation. So to pre-process the data, just complete the following four steps:</p>
<p>Let's create the corpus for the Added column and Removed column, and call it "corpusAdded" and "corpusRemoved" respectively.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="x">library(tm)</span>
<span class="x">corpusAdded = Corpus(VectorSource(wiki</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">Added</span><span class="x">))</span>
<span class="x">corpusRemoved = Corpus(VectorSource(wiki</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">Removed</span><span class="x">))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now, let's remove the English-language stopwords.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>corpusAdded = tm_map(corpusAdded, removeWords, stopwords(&quot;english&quot;))
corpusRemoved = tm_map(corpusRemoved, removeWords, stopwords(&quot;english&quot;))
</pre></div>


<p>Let's stem the words.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>corpusAdded = tm_map(corpusAdded, stemDocument)
corpusRemoved = tm_map(corpusRemoved, stemDocument)
</pre></div>


<p>Let's build the DocumentTermMatrix, and call it dtmAdded and dtmRemoved.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>dtmAdded =  DocumentTermMatrix(corpusAdded)
dtmRemoved =  DocumentTermMatrix(corpusRemoved)
</pre></div>


<p>If we type dtmAdded, we can see that there are <strong>6675</strong> terms. dtmRemoved has <strong>5403</strong> terms.</p>
<p>Let's filter out sparse terms by keeping only terms that appear in 0.3% or more of the revisions, and call the new matrix sparseAdded and sparseRemoved. We can 
create the sparse matrix with the follow line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sparseAdded = removeSparseTerms(dtmAdded, 0.997)
sparseRemoved = removeSparseTerms(dtmRemoved, 0.997)
</pre></div>


<p>If we type sparseAdded, we can see that there are <strong>166</strong> terms and for sparseRemoved, we can see that there are <strong>162</strong> terms.</p>
<p>Now, let's convert sparseAdded to a data frame called wordsAdded, and then prepend all the words with the letter A, and 
sparseRemoved to a data frame called wordsRemoved, and then prepend all the words with the letter R, by using the command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>wordsAdded = as.data.frame(as.matrix(sparseAdded))
colnames(wordsAdded) = paste(&quot;A&quot;, colnames(wordsAdded))
ncol(wordsAdded)

wordsRemoved = as.data.frame(as.matrix(sparseRemoved))
colnames(wordsRemoved) = paste(&quot;R&quot;, colnames(wordsRemoved))
ncol(wordsRemoved)
</pre></div>


<p>Let's combine the two data frames into a data frame called wikiWords with the following line of code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>wikiWords = cbind(wordsAdded, wordsRemoved)
</pre></div>


<p>The cbind function combines two sets of variables for the same observations into one data frame. Then add the Vandal column 
Let's set the random seed to 123 and then split the data set using sample.split from the "caTools" package to put 70% in the training set.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="x">wikiWords</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">Vandal</span><span class="x"> = wiki</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">Vandal</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">library(caTools)</span>
<span class="x">set.seed(123)</span>
<span class="x">spl = sample.split(wikiWords</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">Vandal</span><span class="x">, SplitRatio = 0.7)</span>
<span class="x">wikiTrain = subset(wikiWords, spl==TRUE)</span>
<span class="x">wikiTest = subset(wikiWords, spl==FALSE)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The accuracy on the test set of a baseline method that always predicts "not vandalism" (the most frequent outcome) is <strong>0.5313844</strong>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="x">table(wikiTest</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">Vandal</span><span class="x">)</span>
<span class="x">618/(618+545)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Let's build a CART model to predict Vandal, using all of the other variables as independent variables. We will use the training set to build the model and 
the default parameters.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
wikiCART = rpart(Vandal~., data=wikiTrain, method=&quot;class&quot;)
prp(wikiCART)
</pre></div>


<p>If we plot the tree with prp(wikiCART), we can see that the tree uses two words: "R arbitr" and "R thousa".</p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="../images/RplotWikiTree.png" style="float: middle; width: 450px;"></p>
<p>The accuracy of the model on the test set, using a threshold of 0.5 is <strong>0.5417025</strong>.
(Remember that if we add the argument type="class" when making predictions, the output of predict will automatically use a threshold of 0.5.)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="x">testPredictCART = predict(wikiCART, newdata=wikiTest, type=&quot;class&quot;)</span>
<span class="x">table(wikiTest</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">Vandal</span><span class="x">,testPredictCART)</span>
<span class="x">(618+12)/(618+12+533+0)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Given the performance of the CART model relative to the baseline, Although it beats the baseline, bag of words is not very predictive for this problem. </p>
<h1>Problem-specific Knowledge</h1>
<p>We weren't able to improve on the baseline using the raw textual information. More specifically, the words themselves were not useful. There are other options 
though, and in this section we will try two techniques - identifying a key class of words, and counting words.</p>
<p>The key class of words we will use are website addresses. "Website addresses" (also known as URLs - Uniform Resource Locators) are comprised of two main parts. 
An example would be "http://www.google.com". The first part is the protocol, which is usually "http" (HyperText Transfer Protocol). 
The second part is the address of the site, e.g. "www.google.com". We have stripped all punctuation so links to websites appear in the data as one word, e.g. 
"httpwwwgooglecom". We hypothesize that given that a lot of vandalism seems to be adding links to promotional or irrelevant websites, the presence of a web 
address is a sign of vandalism.</p>
<p>We can search for the presence of a web address in the words added by searching for "http" in the Added column. The grepl function returns TRUE if a string is 
found in another string, e.g.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>grepl(&quot;cat&quot;,&quot;dogs and cats&quot;,fixed=TRUE) # TRUE
grepl(&quot;cat&quot;,&quot;dogs and rats&quot;,fixed=TRUE) # FALSE
</pre></div>


<p>Let's create a copy of our dataframe:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>wikiWords2 = wikiWords
</pre></div>


<p>And make a new column in wikiWords2 that is 1 if "http" was in Added:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="x">wikiWords2</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">HTTP</span><span class="x"> = ifelse(grepl(&quot;http&quot;,wiki</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">Added</span><span class="x">,fixed=TRUE), 1, 0)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Based on this new column, we can see that there are 217 observations with value 1.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="x">table(wikiWords2</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">HTTP</span><span class="x">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We computed a vector called "spl" that identified the observations to put in the training and testing sets. 
Let's use that variable (do not recompute it with sample.split) to make new training and testing sets:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>wikiTrain2 = subset(wikiWords2, spl==TRUE)
wikiTest2 = subset(wikiWords2, spl==FALSE)
</pre></div>


<p>Let's create a new CART model using this new variable as one of the independent variables.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="x">wikiCART2 = rpart(Vandal ~ ., data=wikiTrain2, method=&quot;class&quot;)</span>
<span class="x">testPredictCART2 = predict(wikiCART2, newdata=wikiTest2, type=&quot;class&quot;)</span>
<span class="x">table(wikiTest2</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">Vandal</span><span class="x">, testPredictCART2)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Then the accuracy is (609+57)/(609+9+488+57) = <strong>0.5726569</strong>.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that the number of words added and removed is predictive, perhaps more so than the actual words themselves. We already have a word count 
available in the form of the document-term matrices (DTMs).</p>
<p>Let's sum the rows of dtmAdded and dtmRemoved and add them as new variables in your data frame wikiWords2 (called NumWordsAdded and NumWordsRemoved) by using the
 following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="x">wikiWords2</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">NumWordsAdded</span><span class="x"> = rowSums(as.matrix(dtmAdded))</span>
<span class="x">wikiWords2</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">NumWordsRemoved</span><span class="x"> = rowSums(as.matrix(dtmRemoved))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The average number of words added is mean(wikiWords2$NumWordsAdded)=<strong>4.05</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's split the data again, use the following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>wikiTrain3 = subset(wikiWords2, spl==TRUE)
wikiTest3 = subset(wikiWords2, spl==FALSE)
</pre></div>


<p>We can compute the accuracy of the new CART model with the following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="x">wikiCART3 = rpart(Vandal ~ ., data=wikiTrain3, method=&quot;class&quot;)</span>
<span class="x">testPredictCART3 = predict(wikiCART3, newdata=wikiTest3, type=&quot;class&quot;)</span>
<span class="x">table(wikiTest3</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">Vandal</span><span class="x">, testPredictCART3)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The accuracy for this model is (514+248)/(514+104+297+248) = <strong>0.6552021</strong>.</p>
<p>We have two pieces of "metadata" (data about data) that we haven't yet used. Make a copy of wikiWords2, and call it wikiWords3:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>wikiWords3 = wikiWords2
</pre></div>


<p>Then add the two original variables Minor and Loggedin to this new data frame:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="x">wikiWords3</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">Minor</span><span class="x"> = wiki</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">Minor</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">wikiWords3</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">Loggedin</span><span class="x"> = wiki</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">Loggedin</span><span class="x"></span>

<span class="x">wikiTrain4 = subset(wikiWords3, spl==TRUE)</span>
<span class="x">wikiTest4 = subset(wikiWords3, spl==FALSE)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This model can be built and evaluated using the following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="x">wikiCART4 = rpart(Vandal ~ ., data=wikiTrain4, method=&quot;class&quot;)</span>
<span class="x">predictTestCART4 = predict(wikiCART4, newdata=wikiTest4, type=&quot;class&quot;)  </span>
<span class="x">table(wikiTest4</span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">Vandal</span><span class="x">, predictTestCART4)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The accuracy of the model is (595+241)/(595+23+304+241) = <strong>0.7188306</strong>.</p>
<p>You can plot the tree with prp(wikiCART4). The first split is on the variable "Loggedin", the second split is on the number of words added, and 
the third split is on the number of words removed.</p>
<p>By adding new independent variables, we were able to significantly improve our accuracy without making the model more complicated!<br />
